# Scientific Computing with Python Projects

This repository contains my personal solutions to five projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp **Scientific Computing with Python** curriculum. Each project showcases essential Python programming skills, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

## Projects Overview

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**: Arranges arithmetic problems vertically and optionally displays answers.
2. **Time Calculator**: Computes future times given a start time and duration, handling day transitions.
3. **Budget App**: A class-based budget tracker managing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
4. **Polygon Area Calculator**: Implements Rectangle and Square classes for geometric calculations.
5. **Probability Calculator**: Estimates the probability of drawing specific colored balls through simulation.
